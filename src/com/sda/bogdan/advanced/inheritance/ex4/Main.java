 * 2. Create a public enum Weekday with constants for MONDAY, TUESDAY,... until SUNDAY.
 * The enum should have an instance method boolean isWeekDay()
 *      and an instance method boolean isHoliday().
 *      The isHoliday() method should return the opposite of isWeekDay().
 * 	Write a program which demonstrates how this enum could be used,
 * 	    which has a method which takes a Weekday as the argument
 * 	    and prints a message depending on whether the Weekday is a holiday or not.
 * 	We suggest that the main method loops over all values
 * 	        in the Weekday enum and sends them as argument to the method.
